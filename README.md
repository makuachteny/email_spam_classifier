# email_spam_classifier

Repository contains a machine learning model to classify emails as either spam or non-spam

## Project description

I have used a naive model to classify whether a mail a spam or not. I then developed a web using basic HTML and CSS to provide a UI interface which I then integrated with the backend using Flask API

### Get started here

To check whether your email is a spam or not, follow the steps below:

- Open the site ESC[link()]
- Copy the text from your mail that you to check
- Paste the text in the test area of the web you want to check
- Press the classify button

NB: If the email you entered is a Spam, a red Spam text will be displayed on the screen, otherwise a green Not spam text will appear on the screen.
